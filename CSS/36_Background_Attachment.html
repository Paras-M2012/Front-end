        A long time ago I wanted to write a western. Well, sort of a western. I was looking for something with the thin,
        stretched feel of a spaghetti or revisionist western but set in a dying world. So, a spaghetti dystopia, I
        suppose.

        The idea was pretty simple. The women and children of our world have been killed by a disease called Lifeboats
        Disease, as in women and children first. The men don’t seem to be contracting it but society has fallen to
        ruins. With no hope of a future and no guarantee they won’t all fall ill, the world has become a very different
        place.

        I wanted the main story to tell the story of a young man who is forced to become something worse than the
        murderous monster he was. I wanted him to learn the dangers of hope and faith in a world where neither exactly
        fit. But, before we got to him, I wanted the introduction to be almost a scene setter. A separate little
        vignette set in the same world. A way of setting up the atmosphere before we moved into the story itself.
