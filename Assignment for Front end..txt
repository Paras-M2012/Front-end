3) What are the key steps involved in the programming process?
Types of Programming Languages?
Ans. > Defining the problem, > Planning to solution, > Coding the Program, > Testing and Debugging, > Documentation and Maintenance. 
	Types of program - 1) Machine Language. 2) Assembly Language. 3) High level Language. {include - Python, Java, java script}

4)What are the main differences between high-level and low-level
programming languages?
Ans. Low level languages :  It offers maximum control over hardware but is very difficult for humans to read and write,This is the lowest level language, directly understood by the 	computer's CPU.
	High level languages : They must be translated into machine code by a compiler or an interpreter before the computer can execute them, These are human-readable languages that use                	English-like instructions and are portable across different computer systems.
